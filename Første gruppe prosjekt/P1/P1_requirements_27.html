                    Emilio came to Trondheim one year ago, during this year he has learned
                    more about Norwegian culture and Norwegian food. He has learned to love
                    Norway, but there has always been something missing for him, the delicious
                    food from his home country. Emilio grew up in a small town in Greece,
                    as a child he spent a lot of time in the kitchen with his grandmother,
                    learning about how to prepare delicious greek food. This became a big passion
                    for him, especially after his grandmother passed away 5 months ago.
                    Greek food is today his way of remembering his grandmother and his hometown.
                    Through his restaurant he wants to give the customers a piece of his hometown
                    and show them how amazing food can taste. He has reached out to us for help
                    making the website for the restaurant, to promote the restaurant in the best way possible.

                <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose is to create a website for Emilio’s restaurant.
                    The website gives the restaurant a platform to tell their own
                    story, inform the customers and show rankings. The website is a
                    way to manage reservations, and avoid overbooking. By making the
                    website we will increase the visibility. A website is going to help
                    the restaurant to build a professional image. The website is also
                    going to give direct information for anybody that is looking for
                    specific things. Customers will be able to look at the menu, the menu
                    includes the pricing information. The website is going to provide
                    users with an address, map, email and phone number which will help
                    customers get in touch with the restaurant for any questions or concerns.

                    We plan on using different pictures, so finding
                    non-copyrighted pictures or pictures available for 
                    fair use may become a challenge.
                    Having alot of pictures of the food may also become a 
                    challenge for the loading of the website.
