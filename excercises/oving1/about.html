            <p>
                I have previously had python in ITGK, and used python in other courses, including my master thesis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Constructional dynamics, we used Matlab, which is very similar to python. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My expectations for this course is to learn basic HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                I want to be able to create my own website if I want to.
